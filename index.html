<h1><b>Enrolling in College as an Adult: A Guide</b></h1>

<p>While returning to the classroom can feel intimidating for those who have been away for a number of years, know that it is never too late to start working toward a college degree. The path through higher education has changed significantly in the last 20 years, and the average college student is now <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/most-over-25">over 25 years old</a>. Not only does this mean that adult learners will find a range of age groups on their chosen campus, but many colleges and universities have made adjustments to more traditional practices to make room for working adults.</p>
<p>That said, adult learners should carefully weigh the time commitment and expense of a degree or certificate program before enrolling. For those working full-time jobs and/or raising families, it is important to research both your intended program and institution before committing. This guide will provide guidance for adults as they navigate the process of career exploration and college admission.
</p>
<h2 style="color:orange;">Choosing a Path</h2>
<p>
	Some adult learners already have a path in mind based upon the requirements of their current position, their experience in a certain field, or exposure to a specific career. For those who are sorting out the best path forward it is worth doing research before beginning the admissions process. Below is a list of possible approaches to this research.
</p>
<h3 style="color:orange;">Exploring Your Field</h3>
<h4 style="color:slateblue;">Why do Research?</h4>

<p>Most fields and careers involve more than is on the surface, and there are plenty of resources to give you a better sense of the day-to-day routine associated with a position. Students entering veterinary science fields, for example, often do so because they love animals. However, many are surprised to learn that much of their work is managing the emotions of humans in a high state of distress. Jumping into coursework only to find the job you are pursuing is not a good fit wastes time and money, so do some exploring first.</p>

<h4 style="color:slateblue;">Research Resources</h4>
<p><b>Career assessment tests</b> <br>Career Assessment Tests can be a good starting point when you aren’t sure of your direction. These tests ask a series of questions about your interests and personality and use this information to suggest fields and careers. <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-11-best-career-quizzes-to-help-you-find-your-dream-job">This site</a> offers a detailed list of assessments you can explore.</p>
<p><b>You Tube videos</b><br> A simple You Tube search can turn up a number of informational and day-in-the-life videos. <a href="https://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/c.php?g=959242&p=7266988">Research the source of the video </a> to make sure it is reliable.</p>
<p><b>Industry websites</b><br> If there are organizations, associations, or publications associated with your field, check out their websites and social media accounts. Publications and postings can provide insight into issues relevant to the field as well as information about the kinds of positions available. </p>
<p><b>Information sessions</b> <br>Colleges and universities often hold information sessions for high demand programs. These sessions will offer you information about the academic requirements associated with a degree or certificate as well as the timeline for completion. Sometimes, information about job placement prospects post-graduation is provided. Search institution and program websites for a list of information sessions or email the department to ask if any are upcoming.</p>
<h4 style="color:slateblue;"> What to Research</h4>
	
<p>Getting started on research can feel a bit overwhelming. There are no hard and fast rules about what to look for, but the following will provide a starting place. Dig deeper into any area that feels interesting or relevant.</p>
<p><b>Degrees and certificates in your field</b><br>
There are often multiple avenues into a given career and you want to know the required education level for entry as well as the degrees and certificates you will need to advance. For example, someone interested in nursing could qualify for an entry level position by completing a short Nursing Assistant course, but becoming an RN requires at least an associate degree while working in acute care often requires a bachelor’s degree. Becoming a Nurse Practitioner will require a master’s degree. It all depends on how far you want to go, and you want a sense of possible pathways as you get started.
</p>
<p><b>Position title(s) associated with your field</b><br>
If you are focused on a field (healthcare, education) rather than a specific position (nurse, teacher), take a look at positions that are available within that field. A great place to look are job postings for organizations within your chosen field. If, for example, you are interested in healthcare, take a look at job postings at local healthcare facilities. You would want to look at hospital postings as well as those for specialty offices and clinics. Those interested in education could look at listings for local school districts, postings on college and university websites, and those for private education centers. Job postings are a good resource because they provide information about the requirements for specific positions and the pay range.
</p>
<p><b>Demand for positions</b><br>
Once you have identified specific positions that interest you, find out how in demand they are. Job postings can provide a general sense – many postings often mean a position is in demand – but you can also find statistical information online by conducting a basic Google search and taking a look at industry websites. You will also want to consider where the positions are available. Is there an abundance only in urban centers or specific regions of the country? Are you willing to relocate? These are all things to consider before committing to a degree or certificate program.
</p>
<p><b>Pay rate</b><br>
You will want to consider the entry level payrate for your chosen position(s), which is the hourly rate or salary you could expect post-graduation, as well as the lifetime pay range, which is the maximum salary you could expect to earn. You want to make sure both will be manageable for your lifestyle.
</p>
<p><b>Schedule, modality, and physical requirements</b><br>
You will want to learn about the lifestyle associated with the position(s) you are exploring. Is this a traditional Monday through Friday, 8:00-5:00 position, or will hours be more flexible? Will weekends or evenings be required? What is the length of a traditional shift?
Many positions have shifted online or hybrid since the pandemic, and while these positions may provide greater flexibility you will need to have a place where you can work uninterrupted and have a strong Wi-Fi connection from your home.
Finally, consider the physical requirements of your position(s). Will you be on your feet or at a desk? Are there injuries associated with this work? Many entering the dental field, for example, assume that the strain on their body will be minimal because so much work involves sitting. However, Dental Assistants and Hygienists have high rates of back injuries and tendonitis due to the angles their bodies take on to get into a patient’s mouth. These are the kind of considerations to explore.
</p>
<p><b>Job satisfaction</b><br>
You can find job satisfaction information online and by asking those in the field. Are workers in these fields or positions generally satisfied? Is there typically a lot of movement out of this field, or do workers tend to stick around for the span of their career?
</p>
<h4 style="color:slateblue;">Informational Interviews</h4>
<p><b>What is an informational interview?</b><br>
Informational interviews are conducted with someone in your intended field or position to learn more about the work you are considering.
</p>
<p><b>Conducting Informational Interviews</b><br>
<ol>
	<li><b>Who to ask.</b> Interviews require the time and energy of an interviewee, so reaching out to those with whom you already have a relationship is ideal. This can be a friend, family member, or coworker. If you do not have an existing relationship with someone in the field, you can contact an office or company that specializes in your area. Just know that some may decline your request or not respond at all. If you choose this route, you can call or email specific individuals or make use of the ‘Contact Us’ option on the company website to see if anyone is available to meet with you.</li></p>
	<li><b>How to request an interview.</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Clarify the time commitment</i>. Do not ask for more than 30 minutes of time. You can extend the interview if the interviewee is willing to talk for longer, but make sure to give them an out at the 30-minute point.</li>
		<li><i>Offer multiple modalities</i>. Provide the interviewee with as many meeting options as possible – in-person, Zoom or phone. You can also offer to conduct the interview via email, sending them a list of questions they can answer in writing to return to you when they are able.</li>
		<li><i>Suggest a location</i>. If meeting in-person, provide the interviewee with multiple options. Offer to meet at their place of work, but also suggest an alternative, like a coffee shop. If meeting at the coffee shop or café, plan to pay for their beverage.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>How to prepare for the interview.</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Come prepared with questions</i>. You should have conducted research before meeting with this person and arrive to the interview with a list of 5-10 questions. The ‘What to research’ portion of this guide provides some possible topics. It’s okay if you don’t get to every question, and the conversation may go in an entirely different direction, but having questions ensures that you have material to cover when you meet. Never assume that the interviewee will take the lead in your meeting or come prepared with information. It is your responsibility to set an agenda.</li>
		<li><i>Follow up with a thank you note</i>. Your interviewee is taking time out of their day to meet with you, and this individual could become a networking resource. A thank you is important for both acknowledging the time commitment and building the relationship. A handwritten note is always nice, but an email can also work. Send this within 1 week of meeting. This does not need to be long, but a few lines that thank them for their time and note 1 or 2 things you found helpful can go a long way.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<h2 style="color:orange;">Choosing an Institution</h2>
<h3 style="color:orange;">College Types</h3>
<p>There are 3 types of institutions: 4-year institutions, 2-year institutions, and technical colleges. While there are overlaps in the courses and degrees offered at these schools, there are also big differences. The type of school you choose will be dependent upon the degree or certificate you will pursue as well as your budget.</p>
<p><b>4 Year Institutions</b><br> 4-year institutions are colleges or universities that offer bachelor’s degrees. The degrees offered and overall size of the institution vary, and many offer advanced degrees (masters and doctoral degrees), but you will not find 2 year associate degrees here. If the position(s) you are exploring require a bachelor’s degree you will likely end up at a 4-year institution, but this may not be your starting point. Many students begin at a 2-year institution and then transfer to a 4 year when they are ready to begin coursework in their major area.</p>
<p><b>2 Year Institutions</b><br> 2-year institutions, sometimes called community colleges, offer associate degrees and some certificates. Some offer bachelor’s degrees, but program options for these will be limited. For some positions an associate is all you need, but many positions eventually require a bachelors or higher. However, tuition at a 2-year institution is less than it would be at a 4-year institution, sometimes significantly. Many 2-year degrees are transfer degrees, which means that they are meant for students who plan to complete their first 2 years of a bachelor’s degree at the community college and then transfer. This can be an economical way to approach your education.</p>
<p><b>Technical Colleges</b><br> A technical college is similar to a 2-year college, but most of its degrees and certificates are focused on getting students into specific careers. Programs tend to focus on a particular trade or position (welder, electrician, nurse, etc.), and students are prepared to begin working in this position upon graduation. A technical college is a great route for someone who knows exactly which career they want, but those who are less certain may benefit from a 2 year or 4-year institution that allows them to focus on a field and delay a decision about a specific role.</p>

<h3 style="color:orange;">Accreditation</h3>
<h4 style="color:slateblue;">What is accreditation?</h4>
<p>Institutes of higher education earn accreditation by meeting certain standards. Earning accreditation means that the institution is providing a high level of education and meeting a range of requirements. It also means the institutions can access resources like financial aid, and that the credits they offer will be accepted as valid academically and professionally. <br>

When conducting research, make sure the institution(s) you are considering are regionally accredited. Coursework taken at a nationally accredited or unaccredited institution is often not acknowledged academically or professionally. This means that you may not be able transfer credits earned to another institution or that the degree you earn will not be acknowledged professionally.
</p>
<h4 style="color:slateblue;">Regional versus national accreditation</h4>
You don’t need to understand the ins and outs of the accreditation process, but know that regional accreditation is much better than national accreditation. While national accreditation is usually better than no accreditation, most regionally accredited institutions will not accept transfer credits from these schools. In addition, degrees earned from nationally accredited institutions are often not acknowledge and this may prevent students from qualifying for careers in their field or being able to earn certification offered by the state. Nationally accredited institutions or often for profit schools and/or those offering religious education. Accreditation information should be readily available on an institution’s website, but ask if you can’t find it.
<h3 style="color:orange;">Conducting Research</h3>
<p>As with a career search, you will want to research potential institutions before committing to coursework. You should have a general sense of the programs or areas that interest you before getting started and use this information to guide your search.</p>
<h4 style="color:slateblue;">What to research</h4>
<p><b>Prerequisite requirements</b><br>
Prerequisites are requirements that must be met before beginning program specific coursework. These can be minor, such as placement into a certain level of math or English, or significant, such as 1-2 years of coursework that will prepare you for your program. You want to know what all is involved. An associate degree in nursing, for example, typically includes at least 60 credits of prerequisite coursework, which will take most full-time students 1.5 years to complete. This is on top of the 2-year nursing program, so students should know in advance that they are looking at somewhere closer to 4 years of school to complete a 2 year degree.
</p>
<p><b>Program length</b><br>
Associate degree programs are typically 2 full-time years of coursework, but this is longer for programs with significant prerequisite requirements. Certificate programs, on the other hand, tend to be shorter, anywhere from a few months to a couple of years. There are sometimes multiple avenues into a given field, so explore all of your options before committing.
</p>
<p><b>Application Process</b><br>
Some programs require students to apply to the program. This application is separate from the college or university application you submit. This initial application gets you into the school, but programs are often more competitive. Applicants are typically required to complete prerequisites and submit supplementary information before applying to the program. You want to familiarize yourself with the application process and the percentage of students admitted to the program. For competitive programs, it is not unusual for applicants to have to apply multiple times before being admitted. You will want to take this into account when planning your timeframe.
</p>
<p><b>Program cost</b><br>
You will want to calculate, at least generally, the overall cost of your degree or certificate. You will need to know both the length of the program and total credits, and you can use this to calculate tuition costs. Tuition is always noted somewhere on the institution’s website, and state institutions will provide information for in-state and out-of-state tuition. 

In addition to tuition, you will also want to calculate fees. Fees for labs, student services, and other institutional services are usually on top of tuition. These should be estimated on the website, but you should contact the institution directly if you cannot find this information. In addition, some programs will have additional costs for supplies. You will need to purchase textbooks for most classes, but many programs, particularly those in the trades, require additional equipment. Electrician students, for example, must purchase tools their first quarter and this can cost around $1000. If this information is not readily available, contact the department to ask.
</p>
<p><b>Completion rates</b><br>
An important indicator of program success is the percentage of students who complete the program and earn a degree or certificate. Some attrition is normal, but at least 80% of students, and ideally 90% or higher, should earn their degree or certificate. A low number signals a program that is struggling to adequately support students through coursework.
</p>
<p>
<b>Job placement</b>
<br>
An important question to ask a program representative is how many students are employed post-graduation in their desired field and how long it takes them to find employment. This information is sometimes published on the website, but ask an advisor or department representative if it is not readily available. These numbers will vary by industry, but you want to know that at least 80% of graduates are finding employment in their intended roles within 6 months of graduation. If the percentage is lower, ask for an explanation. Sometimes there are industry specific factors to take into account.
</p>

<h3 style="color:orange;">Where to Conduct Research</h3>
<h4 style="color:slateblue;">Program Websites</h4>

<p>Once you identify a field, program websites are a good starting place. These are often listed in an ‘Academics’ section of the college or university website, but you can also use the search feature. Program sites should list prerequisite requirements and the courses you will take once in the program. When applicable, these should also describe the application process.
Program websites also typically provide contact information for program staff, and these individuals can be a great resource as you research.
</p>

<h4 style="color:slateblue;">Information Sessions</h4>

<p>Programs often offer information sessions that provide details about prerequisites, admission processes, and in-program information. You can typically find scheduling information for these on a program website.</p>

<h3 style="color:orange;">Planning ahead: Funding an Education</h3>

<p>Funding is a key piece of information for most adult learners, and it often informs choices you make about program, degree, and institution. The world of financial aid can feel overwhelming, but there are a few important starting points.</p>

<h4 style="color:slateblue;">Calculate tuition, fees and supplies</h4>

<p>You should start by estimating the overall cost of your program. It is a good idea to put together multiple estimates using the considerations noted above for different programs and institutions so that you can compare and contrast.</p>

<h4 style="color:slateblue;">Funding Types</h4>
<p><b>Federal Funding</b><br>
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is an important starting point. Submitting the application allows you to be considered for federal grants, which do not need to be paid back, as well as student loans. Even if you do not plan to make use of federal funding, you should submit a FAFSA annually as many scholarship and grant applications require that this is on file. To submit, you will need a number of personal and financial documents. Check out the FAFSA checklist for a full list.<br>
The FAFSA can take up to 10 weeks to process, so plan ahead and submit this early.
</p>
<p><b>State Funding</b><br>
Each state is different in terms of its funding, but most have some sort of student aid program. For undocumented students or those without a social security number, state options may be available when federal funding is not. If you cannot find information about state options through a Google search, individual institutions often provide this information. Don’t be afraid to ask.
</p>
<p><b>Employer Funding</b><br>
Many employers provide tuition assistance to students. Ask your HR representative if this is available through your current place of work and what requirements exist to receive funding. Do you need to be a full-time student or employee? Do you need to meet certain grades? Is tuition assistance paid up front or are you reimbursed?
</p>
<p><b>Private Funding</b><br>
Student loans are offered through banks and private lenders, but this should be a last resort. Student loans through FAFSA almost always offer better interest rates and more flexible repayment plans.
</p>
<p><b>Paying out of pocket</b><br>
For those paying out of pocket, many institutions offer payment plans that allow you to spread payments across the quarter or semester rather than paying all at once. Talk to your institution’s Financial Aid office to learn more.
</p>

<h3 style="color:orange;">Applying and Getting Started</h3>
<h4 style="color:slateblue;">Applying</h4>
<p>So you have narrowed in on your intended field or career and identified institutions that best meet your needs. Congratulations! It’s time to apply.</p>

<p><b>Applying to the college or university</b><br>
Your first step will be applying to the college or university. If the college has an outreach or admissions advisor, ask to meet with them. They can walk you through the application process and answer general questions about your program. If you are considering multiple institutions, go ahead and apply to all of them. It is good to have options.
</p>
<p><b>Program Application</b><br>
Some programs have separate applications, and you will need to research your program to see if this is the case. You will need to apply to the institution first, but then try to schedule a meeting with an advisor associated with your program to talk through the process. They can tell if you are ready to apply, describe the application process, and talk you through their program in more detail. They can also help you get registered.
</p>

<h3 style="color:orange;">Conclusion</h3>
<p>First, congratulations on taking this step. Beginning or returning to a college education as an adult can feel intimidating but remember that you have the experience and knowledge to navigate this process. Take it step-by-step and don’t cut corners on the research. Entering this journey with a clear sense of your goals and an understanding of the academic process is the best preparation you can have. You’ve got this!</p>
